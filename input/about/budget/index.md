# .NET Foundation Budget

The .NET Foundation is a 501c6 non-profit, registered in the state of Washington. It operates on a fiscal year starting on July 1 and ending on June 30. The Foundation has two main sources of income: corporate sponsors and individual members.

Quarterly budgets will be posted as available. 

## Fiscal Year 2020 (July 1, 2019-June 30, 2020) 

FY20 is the first year where the majority of operating funds came from outside of Microsoft. Our corporate sponsors donated a total of $210,000 and we received over $26,000 in member dues. 

The Outreach committee is responsible for funding community activities, and its single current expense is for the [Meetup Pro network](https://www.meetup.com/pro/dotnet). The network covers 365 groups in 66 countries containing a total of over 307,000 members. 

Next, Professional Fees covers our lawyers and accountants, supporting our legal needs and tax preparation services. Legal support is a large portion of the .NET Foundation's expenses as we deal with issues that come up project-by-project, including project relicensing, and project ownership. It also covers operational issues, including bylaw and policy updates, and reviewing agreements.

Virtual Inc's fees are in Finance and Accounting, as they have taken over running our books. Additional fees from Virtual will be incurred over the coming year as they provide additional services for coordinating meetings, publishing minutes, and streamlining our membership and sponsor systems. 

Online Service and Subscription expenses cover Office 365, GitHub, Azure, and other smaller expenses. The category is expected to be lower this coming year due to favorable changes in GitHub's pricing and additional grants in Azure credits from Microsoft.

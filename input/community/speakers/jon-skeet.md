Jon is a Staff Developer Relations Engineer working for Google from the London office, building Google Cloud Client Libraries for .NET. But he's probably better known for...

- His Stack Overflow contributions
- The [Noda Time](https://nodatime.org) alternative date/time library for .NET
- His book, C# in Depth

Jon loves playing with C# in work projects, "serious" open source projects (such as Noda Time) and "fun" open source projects such as the [V-Drum Explorer](https://jskeet.github.io/DemoCode/Drums/)

Hi! I'm a principal cloud architect and Microsoft Azure MVP with over 20 years of professional experience. I work for Info Support (www.infosupport.com) designing and developing customer solutions using cloud native architectures. I'm passionate about community and I'm co-organizing the Dutch Azure Meetup and a host on the dotnetFlix podcast (www.youtube.com/dotnetflix).

# Motivation

I'm passionate about .NET and OSS movement. Microsoft has done a tremendous job to make .NET ecosystem great and I want to be a part of it. I enjoy learning new technologies and share my knowledge and experience with others. 

## Goal

I would like to see more interest in .NET among developers in Ukraine. We should popularize technologies and support Ukrainian-speaking developers and produce more available content for them. Please don't turn your back on Ukrainian IT professionals. It is a free market with so many opportunities to take on.

## Experience 

I do my blog and conduct webinars [ITVDN](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzxRv9BtqrM946JmaMLtv_w). 


Cheers,
Alexey

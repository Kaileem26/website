I am an IT professional with over 20 years of experience in IT management, architecture and agile development with a passion for crafting right and beautiful enterprise software solutions built from the outside in, and sharing how we do it. I started a Xamarin user group when I landed in sunny Singapore to help enthusiasts and professionals to maximize the development efforts with this lovely platform and extended the topics to anything fun that got on the way.
I run a boutique tech agency accurately named Xamariners where our team helps companies build or modernize their apps.
Thanks Microsoft & Xamarin for inviting me to join your great MVP community and making a ton of new friends on the way.

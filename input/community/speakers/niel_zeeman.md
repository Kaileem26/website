I've been in industry for over 20 years, the last 10 running my own hustle as freelance developer / consultant. I'm very passionate about technology and have broad experience and knowledge in all thing DevOps, developer and cloud related. 
My primary focus is Microsoft based technologies but take the odd detour if it interests me. 
I frequently speak on new and interesting technologies or concepts and spend my spare time playing with IoT and AI.

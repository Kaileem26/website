David is a developer at Microsoft, working on Roslyn, also known as the C#/VB compiler and IDE tools, in Visual Studio.

A developer for the last 20 years, David has had experience in lots of different languages and environments, from cgi-bin scripts in Perl, to genetic algorithms in VB3, and Windows applications in COBOL. A series of terrible decisions, clearly, but he learnt in the end and now spends most of his time developing with .NET in C#, and enabling other developers to do the same.

David is mostly interested in C#, good design and Lego Technic and Creator Expert cars. He can be found tweeting at [@davidwengier](https://twitter.com/davidwengier), streaming at [https://twitch.tv/davidwengier](https://twitch.tv/davidwengier), helping to organize the DDD Melbourne conference, and on about a dozen different slacks and discords.

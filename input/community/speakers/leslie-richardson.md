Since starting at Microsoft, I have given many talks (primarily on Visual Studio debugging) at internal and external conferences such as Build, Ignite, 1ES, and DevIntersection.  I'm not a fan of super formal talks so I try to keep my speaking style very conversational while telling relatable stories and scenarios that people can engage in and easily understand.  I'm always looking to grow as a speaker, so the more available opportunities there are, the merrier!

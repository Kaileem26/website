Hey! I'm Kayla Cinnamon and I am a Program Manager at Microsoft, currently delivering [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal) and [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code).

I recently graduated with my master's degree in human-computer interaction and I have a background in software engineering and user interface design.

Some of my favorite hobbies include playing board games, cooking, and watching hockey.

Feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cinnamon_msft) if you'd like to chat!

Hi!üëãüèª I'm Steve, and I love talking about software almost as much as I love building it.

I've been a professional developer for the past 15 years, the last 5 as an independent contractor/consultant. While I do consider myself a polyglot, C# and .NET will always feel most like home to me.

I'd love to meet with your group and share about anything from specific technologies to broader principles and best practices. A subset of my previous talks can be found at <https://stevedesmond.ca/talks>.

I'm Davide, a software developer with 7+ years of experience in the .NET world.

I started my blog in 2018 because I found out that explaining even the simplest things to others really helped me understand what's going on. And while with blogs you don't have direct interaction with the audience (except for blog comments, of course!)

So, I've done a few talks about Azure DevOps, both in-person and online. I feel just happy when even one person in the audience reaches out to me to tell me that they've learned just a tiny thing.

I'm working on creating new talks - but no spoilers!

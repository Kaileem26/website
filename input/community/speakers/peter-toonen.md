Hi, my name is Peter Toonen and I'm a tech enthusiast. Working at [Info Support](https://www.infosupport.com) during the day, I get my fair share of developing and architecting (larger) systems in mainly the financial, public and mobility sector. At night (or really just when I'm not at work), I dabble with new technologies and love sharing this with others through conversation, mentoring and public speaking. Although I mainly use .NET, I have spent time developing Java applications in the past and I try to learn at least the basics of a new language every year or so.

I enjoy learning new technologies and new practices and I think that is important to share those learning experiences, the "scars" and the knowledge acquired over the years. I really like to talk to others about technology to learn from them and hopefully share something useful for them. At the moment I'm in the process of starting a youtube channel and reboot my blog so I can start sharing some experiences regularly.

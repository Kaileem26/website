Olga is a Lead Software Engineer at Willis Towers Watson with a prior background in infrastructure. She primarily works within the .NET/Azure space and her current focus is to facilitate solutions to developer and platform needs within her organization.

Over the years, Olga has become passionate about community-building and making sure there is a place for marginalized groups within the tech space. To facilitate this, she co-founded, and mentors at, Inclusive Tech Buffalo which is a group that strives to make the tech community more accessible to women and underrepresented individuals in Buffalo. Additionally, she is one of the co-organizers for the DevOpsDays Buffalo conference which focuses on topics ranging from software development to infrastructure and everything in between, while also putting a large emphasis on diversity and inclusion.

During the rest of her time, Olga enjoys photography, aerial acrobatics, reading, and spending time with her elderly ferret. She likes Star Trek.

I'm a Software Engineer for ASB Bank and a Microsoft Data Platform MVP based in New Zealand. I spend most of my time using .NET and Azure, but I also enjoy hacking on projects using a variety of technologies.

I've been very fortunate to speak at a wide variety of conferences around the world on topics such as Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Functions, C#, ML.NET and Azure Databricks.

Outside from work, I love to kayak and hike when I get the chance

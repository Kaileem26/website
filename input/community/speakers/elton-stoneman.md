I'm a consultant and trainer for Docker and Kubernetes - I help organizations at all stages of their container journey. Containers have been my focus since 2014, I worked at Docker for three years and I'm a Docker Captain. 

I'm also a Microsoft Azure MVP and I spent 10 years consulting on .NET projects before the container revolution, so I have lots of experience in projects to migrate and re-architect older applications.

I've authored multiple books and video courses on Docker and Kubernetes, you can find me on [Pluralsight](https://pluralsight.pxf.io/YMBGB) and [Manning](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-docker-in-a-month-of-lunches?utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=affiliate&a_aid=elton&a_bid=5890141b).

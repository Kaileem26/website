I've been writing JavaScript since the days of Netscape. I've specialized in React since shortly after it was launched, and have partnered with teams around the globe to ship dozens of significant React projects. I've authored multiple courses on C#, React, and JavaScript that have been viewed by over 500,000 developers worldwide. I've trained over 10,000 developers in person, while leading 100's of sessions at businesses and conferences across the USA and internationally.

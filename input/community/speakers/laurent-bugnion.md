I have an extensive speaking experience since 2007, and have spoken at most major Microsoft events, and many 3rd party events. As a member of the Microsoft Cloud Advocates team since 2017, public speaking and content creation is now also my main job,. I am taking part to internal and external initiatives for speaker readiness and am more than happy to mentor other speakers.

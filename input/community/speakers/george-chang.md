George Chang has been working in the .NET and Microsoft tech stack for over a dozen years and have recently focused largely on DevOps, containers, and other cool things that previously weren't so accessible to us Windows-based development folk. As a Sitecore MVP, he's spent a lot of time evangelizing the Sitecore Experience Platform and using Azure as the glue to binds the digital world together.

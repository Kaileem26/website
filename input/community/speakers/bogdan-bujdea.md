Hi! I'm Bogdan Bujdea, .NET Developer at Maxcode and Microsoft MVP on Developer Technologies. The only thing I like more than programming is talking about it, so I'm trying to do this as often as I can as a speaker at conferences and on my blog. I'm currently co-organizing the dotnetdays (https://dotnetdays.ro) conference in Romania and the local .NET user group.

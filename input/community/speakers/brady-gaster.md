Brady Gaster is a principal program manager in the Developer Division at Microsoft, where he works on SignalR, microservices and HTTP APIs, and integration with Azure service teams in hopes to make it exciting for developers who work on .NET apps to party in the cloud. You can find Brady on Twitter at @bradygaster when he's not learning with (or from) his 2 sons, tinkering with code, or making music in his basement using various synthesizers and guitars.

I've been speaking at large and small events for my entire professional life (and even before). Written some books, magazine articles.  Host of the Azure DevOps Podcast. I was a part of the original INETA Speakers' Bureau, and I've spoken at Microsoft TechEd, Ignite, DevTeach, etc. Runner of .NET user groups for many years. I speak professionally at least one a month.  I'd love to contribute and get on your schedule.  Happy to present virtually. All topics relate to delivering software well on the Microsoft platform. All flavors of .NET, Azure, etc.

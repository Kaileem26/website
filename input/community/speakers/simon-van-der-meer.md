Hello there! I am Simon van der Meer, a lead developer at Info Support. My passion lies in finding creative solutions for complex problems. I try to use a broad approach in finding solutions, tapping into all the lessons i've learned in the different disciplines I've fulfilled. I also enjoy very much sharing knowledge about subjects I have expertise in. I do this mainly through speaking at meet-ups and other events.

My non-tech related hobbies include playing guitar and singing in a rockband and I practice several sports such as climbing and kickboxing.

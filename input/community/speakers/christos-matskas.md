Software and cloud engineer, dad, blogger, husband, speaker, and all around geek. I currently works as a Developer Advocate for Microsoft Identity helping developers and teams leverage the power of the identity and cloud. Before joining Microsoft, I was a successful entrepreneur collaborating with companies such as MarkIT, Lockheed Martin and Barclays. I've been building software for over 15 years and I'm truly passionate about Open Source . I try to contribute regularly to OSS projects and I work closely with the developer community to make the space bigger and better.

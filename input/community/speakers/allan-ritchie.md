 I'm a current Microsoft MVP, former Xamarin MVP, and have over 5 million downloads combined between all of my nuget packages.  I've worked with .NET since the very first beta.  I love programming and have been doing it professionally for almost 20 years.  I love sharing my experience from "the trenches" which includes both my successes and my failures.

I have been speaking on technology topics for more than 15 years, having presented more than 400 sessions in that time. I try and specialize in delivering new technology topics with a practical implementation so that attendees are able to use the things they learn in a session right away, rather than speaking in more generalities that are harder to implement.

I have been a Microsoft MVP for 12 years and am also an ASPInsider.  

## Speaking History

My website lists some of my speaking history, however, most of my speaking has been on .NET topics including .NET Core, Entity Framework, ASP.NET and associated technologies. However, I can tailor a session to meet the needs of your particular group if needed.

## Travel

Assuming no restrictions from COVID-19 or otherwise, I am available to travel within the USA at no cost for a number of events each year, assuming a nearby airport is available.  (Does not need to be a major airport, as I fly myself).

## Virtual Events

I also have experience with virtual events and can be available on very flexible schedules to accommodate sessions in pretty much any timezone world wide.

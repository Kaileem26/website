I've been developing software for well over 15 years. 
Currently, I'm working at 4Dotnet as a Cloud Solution Architect and am awarded by Microsoft with the Microsoft MVP award.
My main focus is on developing highly performant and scalable solutions using the awesome services provided by the Microsoft Azure platform. Because of my expertise, I've has been able to help out multiple customers to bring their on-premises solution to the cloud and guide them towards a better software development ecosystem.

Most of my sessions concern something I've learned at a real-life project. So, they aren't just theory, but mainly how I've solved issues in real projects, with real people.

A Software Engineer who is very intense about .NET, world traveller and thinks home is wherever you set your beer down.

I work on an [open source company](https://github.com/getsentry/), building crash reporting SDKs.  
The main topics I'm involved these days are around the platforms .NET, Java, Unity, iOS, Android, React Native and Flutter.

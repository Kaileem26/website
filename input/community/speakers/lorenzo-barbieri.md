Increasing partners' ROI on cloud investments with the right architecture is one of my objectives as a Cloud Solution Architect working for Microsoft. Improving people's public speaking skills is one of my personal goals.

I'm specialized in Cloud Native Applications and Application Modernization, on Azure and Microsoft 365, with Visual Studio, GitHub, and Azure DevOps. I like to talk with people and communities about technology, food, and funny things.
I'm a speaker, a trainer, and a public speaking coach. I've helped many students, devs, other professionals, and many colleagues, improving their stage presence to deliver exceptional presentations.
I work for Microsoft Italy in the One Commercial Partner Technical Organization, helping partners, developers, communities, and customers, supporting software development on Microsoft and OSS technologies.
I've managed teams of more than twenty people, and now I enjoy when I can lead virtual teams to drive specific results.
I'm a Microsoft Certified Trainer since 2000 and a former Microsoft MVP for ALM, DevOps, and Virtual Machines.
I write articles for Italian IT magazines, and I speak at conferences in Italy and Europe, and I've published three (free) e-books and a book about Azure Serverless.

Specialties: Cloud Architectures, Public Speaking, Training, Software Development, Problem Solving, Team Development, Coaching

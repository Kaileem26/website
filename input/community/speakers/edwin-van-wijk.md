Hi, I'm Edwin van Wijk. I have been working in IT since 1999 and currently working as Principal Solution Architect and Microsoft Community Lead at Info Support in The Netherlands. I'm a Microsoft MVP (since 2016). My primary areas of expertise are: building distributed systems, systems integration, (cloud-native) software architecture and patterns, software craftsmanship, .NET (Core) development, Azure and DevOps. Because I believe that sharing knowledge is important, I speak regularly about these subjects on conferences in different countries and run dotnetFlix, a video channel for developers.

With over 25 years in software development (almost 15 of which is .NET), Dr. Bill brings a pragmatic (curmudgeonly?) approach to software development. With much of that time spent in consulting, he has worked on many different projects and used many different designs and approaches. He recently switched to the dark side and uses his development experience as a .NET developer advocate with AWS, helping AWS to build a better and more rich .NET developer experience.

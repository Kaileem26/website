Well, hello there.  My name is Scott and I am an enterprise software developer who has been programming with Microsoft technologies since the 90s.  During the day I lead a large team of software engineers at [U.S. Bank Community Development Corp](https://www.usbank.com/corporate-and-commercial-banking/solutions/credit-and-financing/community-development.html).

You can also find me teaching the C# course for the [CoderGirl](https://www.launchcode.org/coder_girl) program at LaunchCode.

My primary topics of interest are ASP.NET MVC, Blazor, and building cross platform applications.  I also dabble in Windows Desktop development.

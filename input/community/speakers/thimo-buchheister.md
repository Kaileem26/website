I'm running a .Net Meetup (Ibbenb√ºren .NET Meetup) for a few years now. I'm talking there about my .Net experience I got in my current job as CEO of ThreeB IT as well as my former positions as CTO and software engineer in other companies. I think my deep knowledge about web development in all flavors with .Net (Core) can help others to develop awesome web applications.

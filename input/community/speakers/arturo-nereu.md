Arturo is a developer advocate for Operate Solutions. Even before he finished his computer science degree in 2011, he'd been prototyping and developing games for console and mobile for four years. Arturo is passionate about computer graphics, game-feel and programming, and a diehard horror fan in any format. As a Unity developer advocate, he loves it when users ask him questions he doesn't know the answer to, so everyone gets to learn from real-life scenarios together. Arturo's work focuses on Unity's operate, monetize, and engagement solutions.

Hi ğŸ‘‹ 
I'm told that I'm good at making people interested, especially when I speak about my favorite topics... Whether it is mobile technologies, C# in general, tips and tricks to be efficient when coding or even just talking about my many professional (mis)adventures.
I am always happy to help and sharing knowledge and experience has helped me, so I want to give back. 
It's like when you fork a GitHub repo and improve its content... The minimum would be to give back in a PR... Well, I've forked my mentor's knowledge, built a few things upon it and it's time to give back.

For my experience, I :
- am a former Microsoft MVP, 
- am a former Start-up CTO in Toronto
- have participated to more than 20 Hackathons as participant (Won 5), coach and sometimes jury
- have worked in 10+ IT companies
- have worked with bots, matching apps, social media management apps... many different types of projects. Currently in the medical field.

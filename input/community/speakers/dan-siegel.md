Dan is a Microsoft/Xamarin MVP, an avid OSS Contributor and Author best known as for his work as a maintainer of the immensely popular Prism Library. By day he works as a Consultant specializing in Cloud, Mobile and DevOps. He loves to share his passion for developing mobile apps with developers around the world and is the organizer for the Xamarin Developer Summit.

In those arguably rare moments he's not busy slinging code you might find him out Scuba Diving, Off-Roading or through hiking in the remote wilderness, pretty much unplugged.

Mark is a software development consultant with over 30 years of professional experience, 20 of which have been spent working with C# and .NET. He is a regular speaker at international conferences including NDC, Build Stuff, GOTO and QCon, as well as user groups in the UK and (in this Age of Zoom) around the world, and delivers workshops on various aspects of .NET application development including gRPC, performance optimization and more.

He is currently working on [Visual ReCode](https://visualrecode.com), a tool to help developers migrate their .NET 4.x code to .NET Core 3.1 and .NET 5.0, and a new open source project, [Cocoon](https://github.com/visualrecode/cocoon), that mixes new ASP.NET Core apps with legacy ASP.NET apps. You can watch him working on that on his [Twitch stream](https://twitch.tv/markrendle).

Let's see, what else? Oh, yeah: he's a Microsoft MVP; he is the co-author of [gRPC for WCF Developers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/grpc-for-wcf-developers/); and he messes around with game development using Unity in his spare time.

Well this is always the interesting part isn't it, honest truth I'm just a regular dev, have been for 30 or more years now.

I do what I do, and I do it well, I speak because I enjoy it, I speak because I have a sense of community.

If you want the obligatory bio stuff, then:

I wrote my first bit of code in may 1979 at the age of 7, by the time I was 10 I was programming chip level in machine code on the Z80 & 6502 CPU's, moving into my teenage years I was programming Arm cpu's before anyone knew what they where.

I don't really sell myself, I'm a dev after all not a marketer, but there's not many areas of I.T. I've not worked in, from hardware to software, support to management.

These days I'm best known for my activities in the .NET & MS Dev scene here in the UK, My blog posts frequently appear on other outlets as well as my own blog, and if you've got the time to sit and listen to what I have to say, I've certainly got the time to tell you.

I'm a veteran of the "Developer Developer Developer"  series of live developer events here in the UK, and one of the main figures behind "LiDNUG" (http://lidnug.org) on the linked in network.

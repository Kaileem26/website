Scott is an 11-time C# MVP, author, software architect, developer, and speaker who has been involved with computers in one way or another for as long as he can remember but started professionally in 1993. He has worked at Fortune 500 companies and privately held start-ups focused on IT consulting where he gained experience in embedded systems design and software development to systems administration and database programming, and everything in between.

After spending 6 years as a systems administrator, Scott started developing eCommerce storefronts. Since 2001, he has worked on many different projects using .NET and C#. Although his primary focus right now is commercial software applications, he prefers building infrastructure components, reusable shared libraries, and helping companies define, develop, and automate process standards and guidelines.

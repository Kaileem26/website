I am the founder of Intelligent Hack, an innovative consulting startup focused on helping you grow your company from thousands to millions, through improving company culture, implementing agile methodologies and remote work, rearchitecting for scale, and paying tech debt. I was part of the Stack Overflow core development team I was Toptal's first Engineering Manager where I helped implement agile and focused on reducing technical debt. I have also been a signed pro musician, a game audio engineer, and a music producer.

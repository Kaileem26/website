Hi! I'm Drew Noakes and I am a developer at Microsoft, working at the intersection of .NET and Visual Studio.

My education was in electronics though my work history has mostly involved software, designing algorithmic trading systems, building autonomous humanoid robots from the ground up, developing race analytics for Formula One, and building educational software for use in classrooms.

I've been involved in open source since 2000 and maintain several projects, some of which have more users than I would ever have imagined possible. I love how software brings people together and how technology reduces the barrier to contribution and collaboration.

Some of my hobbies are 3D printing, beekeeping, cooking and playing guitar.

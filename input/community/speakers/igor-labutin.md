I gave talks at our local Saint Petersburg .NET community and one of my talks is in the top 5 over few years of history (https://www.youtube.com/c/DotNetRu/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid, number 5 for now).
I also gave several talks at the DotNext conference - the largest .NET-related event in Russia (https://dotnext.ru/).
Nowadays I'm member of the DotNext program committee and also help running the SpbDotNet community.
I'm interested in topics around performance, builds and tooling.
Never tried presenting in English at conferences and meetups, but I'm ready to try and I'm sure it'll work out.

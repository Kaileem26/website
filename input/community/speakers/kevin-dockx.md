Kevin Dockx is a freelance solution architect, author & consultant, living in Antwerp (Belgium). These days he's mainly focused on RESTful architectures & security for web applications and mobile applications. That said, he still keeps an eye out for new developments concerning other products from the Microsoft .NET stack. 

He is a Microsoft MVP and a board member of the RD MS Community. He's also a regular speaker at various national and international conferences & user group events, and works on various open source projects, like Microsoft.AspNet.JsonPatch & Marvin.Cache.Headers. 

Kevin likes to travel to places he hasn't seen before, and enjoys a good glass of wine in the company of a few good friends.

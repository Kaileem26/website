Hello!

I am Michaël Hompus and I am a developer and architect. I work at [Info Support](https://www.infosupport.com).
My passion is to share knowledge, with colleagues, customers and my peers. For this I try to write articles and speak at events.

My background is in Microsoft based technologies. From the beginning of my professional career I have worked with .NET and C#.
With product like SharePoint, Azure, Azure DevOps, Office 365, and Dynamics 365, just to name a few.

These days I try to combine tools together to get the work done for me, like using Roslyn to generate documentation, or to use ML.NET to get me achievements on my Xbox.

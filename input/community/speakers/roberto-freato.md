I'm a Solution Architect, Conference Speaker, Author (7 books), CTO @Witailer and Microsoft Azure MVP. 
I've been an independent IT consultant since I started to work.
After my MSc in computer science engineering with a thesis about consumer cloud computing I got specialization in Cloud and Azure.
I wrote some books on Microsoft Azure, for K12 education and I train/speak for the developer community in many national and international conferences.
I hold 45+ technical certifications on various vendors (MS, Sun, EXIN, Apple, Cisco, IBM) and I am a Microsoft MVP since 2010.
In the last years I've been also CTO for ReStore, an eCommerce company leading the Click & Collect Italian eCommerce market for grocery, and now for Witailer, a leading company in the Amazon and eMarketplace services for brands.

Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is TamÃ¡s Deme, and I'm **working on a future I'd like to live in, and not one I'd like to read about**.

During a presentation I once said "we didn't know that it was impossible so we did it". I thrive in environments with challenging problems and teams that match those. I battled obscure formats, I consolidated coordinate systems and I forced time zones to my will.

I do most of these things using a c# / .net stack, on devices ranging from servers to a head-mounted display that shows you holograms.

Currently I'm working as a mixed reality engineer at VIM AEC. Since January 2016, I've been a Windows development Microsoft MVP.

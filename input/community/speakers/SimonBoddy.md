It took a long time, but "typed raw SQL" is now emerging as a method for relational data access for applications.  The approach, based obviously on SQL, is characterised by two things: SQL must exist as a top level language in the host application (SQL errors must be compile errors), and data types from the DB must flow seamlessly into the application.  

In a rivetting presentation with live coding, I will present the approach, various implementations for typescript, scala and Go, before presenting my own implementation for .net and C#, QueryFirst. QueryFirst supports SQL Server, Postgres and MySql, and is distributed as an extension for [Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bbsimonbb.QueryFirst) and [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SimonBoddy.queryfirst), and as a multi-platform [.net global tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/QueryFirst/). 

This is not rocket science, but it's an innovation of immediate practical relevance to lots of developers, and the presentation has never failed to generate interest. It's also a standout story of .net community open source and the multi-platform capability of .net 5.

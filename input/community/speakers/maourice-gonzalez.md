I've been building .NET applications for almost half of my life, started with VB, moved to C# and fell in love with Silverlight. My journey has been full of twists and turns, some by my own hand, some not so much. I was heavily invested in Windows Phone development and eventually transition to Windows Mobile, only to have the rug pulled out from under me. Now my focus is on ASP.NET MVC Razor and Blazor as well as ASP.NET Web API. I am director of software for a fintech company which juggles two very distinct stacks. .NET and Jakarta EE. Some of the challenges I face are converting legacy ASP.NET Webforms and WCF systems to modern API and MVC focused applications with a huge emphasis on scalability and security. I still have a ton of things to learn, but I've picked up a wealth of knowledge on my journey. Sharing those experiences and knowing I could help make a different would be amazing!

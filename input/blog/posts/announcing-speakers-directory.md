As part of the .NET Foundation's goals to help broaden the appeal of .NET, we're proud to announce the .NET Foundation's new [Speakers Directory](https://dotnetfoundation.org/community/speakers). The goal of the directory is to help people discover and encourage speakers from around the world as weell as to provide mentors for new speakers. 

If you're looking for a speaker for your upcoming user group or event, you can find speakers that match your needs by visiting [The Speakers Bureau](/community/speakers):

This will allow you to find speakers by language and technology. You can even use the map to find speakers near you:

With approximately 250 speakers so far, we're excited to bring this new feature to the .NET Foundation!

We invite you to [add yourself to the directory](https://dotnetfoundation.org/community/speakers), act as a mentor if you'd like, and contribute to building up the global list of community speakers.

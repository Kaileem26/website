Hi folks!

Back in the [State of the Union](/blog/2020/07/30/state-of-the-net-foundation-summer-2020), we mentioned an upcoming live meeting open to all. We have scheduled the first of these for Tuesday, October 13th, at 11:30-12:30 Eastern Daylight Time. For this first meeting, the format will be a panel discussion with the Board of Directors, Committee Chairs, and the Executive Director. The event will take place via Teams Live Meetings and feature live Q&A from questions submitted from the public. We'll also take questions in advance.

Submit questions in advance with [this form](https://forms.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=3G8HFsH8FUqxyjLJolWQDtxAVwyU3HJJo4I9O9ugmk9UREo1SDlKWFVIQzFZT1daMkRPU1FKNVU5Uy4u), and during the event with Teams' Q&A feature. We recognize that the audience for .NET is global and as we continue to hold these quarterly, we will vary the time to accommodate different time zones. The full recording will always be available afterwards.

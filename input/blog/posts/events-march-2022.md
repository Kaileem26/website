Are there any boundaries to what you can build with .NET? Not really! Join us for two full days on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/vmwaretanzu) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL-I886aqCk) as we look at how some of the smartest voices in the .NET community are using it to develop for the enterprise—and at scale.

No matter where you fit in the .NET spectrum, you’re guaranteed to pick up something you haven’t learned yet.

All proceeds from sponsorships of the event will be going to [GirlsWhoCode](https://girlswhocode.com/)!


## Join the .NET Foundation's sponsor [Volosoft](https://volosoft.com/) for their next Youtube Live Community Talk on April 7th!
